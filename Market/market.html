		The South Melbourne market is a covered food and general goods market located in South Melbourne, Victoria, Australia. It began operating in 1867, and is a Victorian style of building with wood and red brick. The market is known for its dim sims, which were originally made by chef Ken Cheng.
		<br><br>
In its lifetime the market has undergone various refurbishments, including after numerous fires. The worst of these was in 1981 when two of the original sheds were destroyed and, later in the year, stalls were damaged by bombs. In 2007/2008, the market's produce areas were redesigned, and in 2012 a new roof was added to reduce leaking and heat load.
