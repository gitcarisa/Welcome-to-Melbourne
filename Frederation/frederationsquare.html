	<p>Federation Square is a venue for arts, culture and public events on the edge of the CBD of Melbourne. It covers an area of 3.2 ha (7.9 acres) at the intersection of Flinders Street and Swanston Street built above busy railway lines and across the road from Flinders Street station. It incorporates major cultural institutions such as the Ian Potter Centre and ACMI and Koorie Heritage Trust as well as cafes and bars in a series of buildings centred around a large paved square, and a glass walled atrium. The corner is occupied by a glass walled pavilion that provides access to the underground Melbourne Visitor Centre.</p>
